description
=============

- a basic doubly linked list that has been written as generically as possible to be able to be used multiple times in the future

====================
known limitations
====================
- no compare function was written so it will most likely have issues dealing with anything resulting in comparisons.
- the code was able to make it through most of the testing suite provided by the teacher, although there isnt a personalized testing piece written to be manually tested.
- the list seg faults when attempting to insert at the front of a null list apparently.
- code won't work with make file although the makefile is properly written, will only work with self testing suite.
