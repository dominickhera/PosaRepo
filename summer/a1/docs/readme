description
=============

- what shouldve been a four way stop sign intersection which would accruately take in data from a datafile given in the command line and figure out how long each car waits in order to figure out the max time a car had to wait to cross as well as the average of all the wait times compiled together. being the person i am, of course i procrastinated until the last second and ended up only doing partial the work and it's now the middle of the night where i am no longer able to focus.

====================
known limitations
====================
- the program doesn't properly cycle through the files so it will output incorrect data as the max and average wait times
- ended up using arrays to sort and deal with the data despite inserting them into queues as originally requested
- multiple functions end up being unused
- lord have mercy on my soul and my grade.
