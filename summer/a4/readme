description
=============

- the program is a basic Point of Sale system that utilizes a binary search tree for storing all the primary information which the program pulls all the information from, using a hash table to store only the Product ID's when the user attempts to add a product by that ID in which the program will call back to the binary search tree to find the information regarding that product ID and pulling it up. A doubly linked list is used to handle the users shopping cart or invoice which they can add to or remove from without any issues.
