======
to run
======
./bin/run

==========
to compile
==========
type 'make' to run the makeFile
or 'make -f makeFile' if that does not work

====================
known limitations
====================
- ackermanns function only seems to go up about A(4,1) which in its' own seems to take about a minute to compute
- entering anything besides a number the main menu goes into an infinite loop

=======
testing
=======
- ackermanns kept spinning into crazy numbers when two small numbers were 
entered, fixed by chaning if else statement into seperate if then statements
- newtons kept segfaulting when attempting to run the recursive version of the function, was fixed 
by changing the way the function worked by having the e and x values be called into the function instead of being pre defined in the function
