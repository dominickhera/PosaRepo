 * CIS2750 F2017

 * Assignment 1

 * Dominick Hera 0943778

 * This file contains the implementation of the linked List API that also utilises an iterator to traverse through the doubly linked list.

 * This implementation is based on the List API that I implemented in my Assignment 1 for CIS2520, which I took

 * in the summer of 2017 with professor Judi McCuaig.  The permission to use my CIS2520 code in CIS2750 was obtained on my behalf by

 * my current CIS2750 professor, Denis Nikitenko.
